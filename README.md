## ðŸš€ Getting Started


### Env variables (.env.sample)
- There are 2 files that contain an example of an .env file setup, in the backend and frontend directory.

-  The **.env.sample** file has the enviroment variables needed for the backend app frontend and mongodb database set up.

- Follow the instructions inside **.env.sample** to create a .env file in each directory for development or production.

### Run project locally (Dev)

> [!NOTE]
> **Docker** should be installed in order to host locally the mongodb.
>
> **NodeJS** should be installed. 

To run this project locally lets go throught the following steps:

1. Firstly clone this repository:

```bash
clone <add-your-git-repo>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and optionally have 2 terminal windows open so that you can have the backend directory in the first one and the frontend directory in the second one.
```bash
cd backend

cd frontend
```

3. Make sure both directories have a **.env** file created with the **development** setup.

4. In the backend terminal run the following command in order to pull a mongodb image and host the database locally.

```bash
# \backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mongo.yaml up -d
```

5. When the db container is up and running, install depedencies and run the app

```bash
# \backend 
npm install
npm run start
```
```bash
# \frontend 
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Setup with docker (Running app in production)

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have **Docker** installed 

1. Make sure that backend and frontend directories have .env files with the **Production** setup

2. In the root directory run the following command to build the full-stack app with Docker Compose. This command will build and run the NestJS app, build the React app and serve it with Nginx host a MongoDB database and manage all network connections.

```bash
docker-compose up --build 
```
