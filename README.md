## ðŸš€ Getting Started


### Env variables (.env.sample)
- There are 2 files **.env.sample** in each directory backend and frontend, that contain a sample of the environment variables needed for the set up.
- Follow the instructions inside **.env.sample** to create a .env file in each directory for development or production.

### Run project locally (Dev)

> [!NOTE]
> **Docker** should be installed in order to host locally the mongodb and **NodeJS** for building and running the app.

To run this project locally lets go throught the following steps:

1. First clone this repository:

```bash
clone <add-your-git-repo>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and optionally have 2 terminal windows open, so that you can operate the backend directory and the frontend directory simultaneously.
```bash
cd backend

cd frontend
```

3. Make sure both directories have a **.env** file created with the **development** setup.

4. In the backend terminal window run the following command in order to pull a mongodb and mongo-express images, create container and host the database locally.

```bash
# \backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.mongo.yaml up -d
```

5. Make sure container is up and running, install npm depedencies and run the app.

```bash
# \backend 
npm install
npm run start
```
```bash
# \frontend 
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Setup with docker (Running app in production)

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you have **Docker** installed.

1. Make sure that backend and frontend directories have .env files with the **Production** setup

2. In the root directory run the following command to build the full-stack app with Docker Compose.
   
   The following command will
    - build and run the NestJS app,
    - build the React app and serve it with Nginx,
    - host a MongoDB database,
    - manage all network connections.

```bash
docker-compose up --build 
```
